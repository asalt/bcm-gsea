Summary. Getting initial bearings in the repo and setting up required logging files.
Highlights.
- Created `dev/` and `logs/` scaffolding to satisfy logging requirement.
Challenges.
- None so far.
Suggestions.
- None at this stage.

## 2025-09-16T20:28:31-05:00
Summary. Completed a top-down survey of the R modules and corresponding tests to understand current coverage and risks.
Highlights.
- Catalogued core R modules and noted how the lazy loader wires them for runtime use.
- Skimmed unit/integration tests to match them against module responsibilities.
Challenges.
- Several files (e.g., `R/db.R`, `R/listen.R`) contain side-effect-heavy logic that complicates reasoning about missing tests.
Suggestions.
- Consider adding lightweight smoke tests around WebSocket/voice hooks once we can mock external dependencies.

## 2025-09-16T20:38:39-05:00
Summary. Ran the CLI unit test to confirm the harness still passes before expanding coverage.
Highlights.
- `R/tests/unit_tests/test_cli.R` executed cleanly and printed expected parser usage output.
Challenges.
- None; command completed quickly.
Suggestions.
- Proceed to broaden run-loop tests now that baseline is verified.

## 2025-09-16T20:57:31-05:00
Summary. Hardened `simulate$generate_test_data()` so FGSEA tests run deterministically under `SerialParam()` and stay resilient when first-pass runs error out.
Highlights.
- Registered `BiocParallel::SerialParam()` and suppressed NULL results before wiring into cache writeback.
- Ensured simulated outputs always include a `mainpathway` column with both TRUE/FALSE when collapse-mode is requested.
Challenges.
- `fgsea::fgsea()` can return NULL per rank; needed to strip those while preserving names to avoid downstream type fallthrough.
Suggestions.
- Add explicit fixtures for FGSEA goldens once we wire the snapshot harness.

## 2025-09-16T21:15:11-05:00
Summary. Reworked the run-loop unit test to operate in isolated temp directories, optionally retaining artifacts for debugging.
Highlights.
- Added optional FGSEA mocking plus quiet plotting flags to keep the test fast and hermetic.
- Confirmed `R/tests/unit_tests/test_run.R` now passes after the refactor.
Challenges.
- Needed to neutralize heavy fgsea/plotting branches to avoid timeouts in the sandbox.
Suggestions.
- Consider extracting the fake fgsea helper into shared test utilities as we expand coverage.

## 2025-09-16T21:22:16-05:00
Summary. Added a deterministic fgsea snapshot test with a golden fixture to guard the aggregation pipeline.
Highlights.
- Created `test_fgsea_snapshot.R` that generates temp ranks/genesets and compares `run_all_pathways` output against an RDS fixture.
- Stubbed fgsea and leading-edge mapping to keep the test fast and hermetic, plus stored baseline in `fixtures/fgsea_basic_results.rds`.
Challenges.
- Real fgsea runs were brittle for tiny gene sets; switched to a deterministic stub.
Suggestions.
- Extract shared stubs (fgsea + leading edge mapper) into a helper if more tests need them.

## 2025-09-16T21:35:37-05:00
Summary. Replaced the deprecated `flatten_chr()` call in the lazy loader with `purrr::list_c()` to silence tidyverse warnings.
Highlights.
- Updated `R/lazyloader.R` to use supported purrr helpers and verified sourcing via `Rscript`.
Challenges.
- None; change was mechanical.
Suggestions.
- Keep an eye out for other deprecated purrr helpers during future touch-ups.

## 2025-09-16T21:40:30-05:00
Summary. Captured end-of-session wrap-up and next steps before breaking.
Highlights.
- Documented tempdir run-loop test hardening, fgsea snapshot fixture, helper extraction, and lazyloader cleanup.
Challenges.
- None during this pass.
Suggestions.
- Explore parameterised stubs and broader run-loop scenarios when we resume.
